# Flask Phone Market

## Quick Info

This project is created using **Flask**, an **SQLite** database, and **Bootstrap**. It makes full use of various Flask features such as database migrations, WTForms, token serialization, and Flask-Login.

Upon registering, each user receives \$1000 to spend on the Phone Market. Logged-in users can view product details, buy or sell devices, and manage a personal profileâ€”including uploading a profile picture (all images are automatically resized to 125x125px). Additionally, users can participate in a forum where they can create, edit, or delete posts, and view posts from other users by clicking on their username or profile picture. Should a user forget their password, a reset email (requiring proper email configuration) is sent with a reset token.
